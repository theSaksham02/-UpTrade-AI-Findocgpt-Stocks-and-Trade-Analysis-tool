## 📊 Success = 3 Metrics

After 30 days of launch, if you see:

✅ Conversion rate: 5-10%  (5-50 new Pro users)
✅ Churn rate: <5%/month   (retention is working)
✅ NPS score: >40          (users are happy)

Then you're on track! 🎉

❌ Churn >10%              (need better features)
❌ NPS <20                 (product issues)

Then iterate and fix! 💪
