   - Rate limiting prevents abuse
   - Support scales with revenue
   - Margins improve with scale

## 🚨 Common Questions Answered

**Q: Won't everyone just use Free tier?**
A: No. Free tier is deliberately limited. After hitting limits (50 quotes/day), users see "Upgrade to Pro" prompts. 5-10% convert.

**Q: Is $29.99/month too expensive?**
A: No. Less than daily coffee. Industry standard for SaaS. Users who need it will pay.

**Q: What if no one buys Enterprise?**
A: Direct sales takes time. Start with inbound (existing users → Enterprise). Month 6+ you'll see deals.

**Q: How do I prevent free user abuse?**
A: Rate limiting. Free: 100 calls/day. Pro: 10k. Prevents scraping/abuse.

**Q: Will free users hate being limited?**
A: No. They're exploring. Limits are reasonable (50 quotes/day = many trades). They understand value of paid.

**Q: When should I launch?**
A: 30 days of build = 2-3 weeks realistic. Launch ASAP, iterate based on data.
